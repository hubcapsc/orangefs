You add servers by copying the OrangeFS installation directory from the
Build system to each Server system designated in your OrangeFS solution.
You must also consider additional setup and configuration tasks for
security. Then you can start up each server you have added.

The OrangeFS servers make up your actual file system. The servers
provide the space across which all data and metadata are distributed and
managed for optimal storage and retrieval.

Adding servers includes the following topics:

-   [Copy OrangeFS Installation
    Directory]({{<relref "Copy_OFS_Install_Directory_(Servers)">}})
-   [Set up Security]({{<relref "Set_Up_Security_(Servers)">}})
-   [Run]({{<relref "Server-Startup">}})
-   [Review Results]({{<relref "Results_of_Add_Servers">}})
